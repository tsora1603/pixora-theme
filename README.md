# pixora-theme
Taking the legacy of an archived 16-bit icon theme and adding my own work to it.

# 🖥️ How to Install

## 1. Clone the repo 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsora1603/pixora-theme.git
cd pixora-theme
```
<br>

## 2. Launch the installation script
This will either: <br><br>
a. Symlink the files into place, allowing for easy updates by running `git pull`; <br>
b. Copy-paste the files in the right directories, allowing for a fully local installation.

```bash
./install.sh
```

> _If install.sh doesn't run, try ```chmod +x install.sh``` and then run it again._
