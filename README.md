# Installation
1. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/tsora1603/pixora-theme.git```
2. Navigate to the icon theme directory ```cd pixora-theme```
3. Launch ```./install.sh```

> _If install.sh doesn't run, try ```chmod +x install.sh```_

# How to contribute with art
You'll need:

1. A pixel art editor ([LibreSprite](https://libresprite.github.io/#!/) is great!);
2. 16x16 canvas size;
3. Make use of the [Resurrect 32 color pallete](https://lospec.com/palette-list/resurrect-32) for consistency;
4. Inkscape to vectorize the icons.
