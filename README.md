# pixora-theme
taking the legacy of an archived 16-bit icon theme and adding my own work to it.

# 🖥️ how to install

## 1. clone the repo 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsora1603/pixora-theme.git
cd pixora-theme
```
<br>

## 2. launch the installation script
this will either: <br><br>
a. symlink the files into place, allowing for easy updates by running `git pull`; <br>
b. copy-paste the files in the right directories, allowing for a fully local installation.

```bash
./install.sh
```

> _If install.sh doesn't run, try ```chmod +x install.sh``` and then run it again_

# 🎨 how to contribute with art
you'll need:

1. a pixel art editor ([LibreSprite](https://libresprite.github.io/#!/) is great!);
2. 16x16 canvas size;
3. make use of the [Resurrect 32 color pallete](https://lospec.com/palette-list/resurrect-32) for consistency;
4. inkscape to vectorize the icons.
