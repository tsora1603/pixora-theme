## Local Installation

### 2. Launch the installation script
This will either: <br>
a. Symlink the files into place, allowing for easy updates by running `git pull`; <br>
b. Copy-paste the files in the right directories, allowing for a fully local installation.

```bash
./install.sh
```

> _If install.sh doesn't run, try ```chmod +x install.sh``` and then run it again._
